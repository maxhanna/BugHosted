            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This dropdown menu allows you to choose between two distinct trading
                strategies: Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) or Indicator-based (IND) trading. DCA involves making regular
                investments at set intervals, regardless of market conditions, while IND uses technical market
                indicators to decide when to buy or sell.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your choice here fundamentally shapes how your trading bot behaves. DCA
                is ideal for long-term investors who want to mitigate the effects of market volatility by spreading out
                their purchases over time. IND, on the other hand, is suited for traders who prefer to react to market
                signals, potentially capitalizing on short-term price movements.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Select "DCA" if you're aiming for a steady, disciplined investment
                approach—think of it like setting up a recurring buy order to build your position gradually. Choose
                "IND" if you're comfortable with a more dynamic strategy that relies on market indicators (like moving
                averages or RSI) to trigger trades. Your selection will determine which additional settings are
                displayed below.</p>

            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This dropdown lets you pick the cryptocurrency you'll be selling or
                trading from—essentially, the "source" coin in your trading pair. For DCA, you have a broader selection
                (e.g., BTC, ETH, XRP), while IND restricts you to BTC only due to its strategy-specific requirements.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The coin you choose here defines one half of your trading pair and
                influences how your funds are allocated. For example, selecting BTC means you're trading BTC to USDC.
                This choice also affects liquidity and volatility considerations, as different coins have different
                market behaviors.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Pick the cryptocurrency you currently hold and want to trade. If you're
                using DCA, you might select ETH if that's your primary holding, allowing you to diversify your trades.
                For IND, you're locked into BTC, so ensure you have sufficient BTC in your wallet. The options adjust
                dynamically based on your strategy selection above.</p>

        </select>
        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This dropdown specifies the cryptocurrency you'll receive after a
                trade—known as the "target" coin. Right now, it's fixed to USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar,
                meaning all trades will convert your source coin into USDC.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The target coin is where your investment ends up after each trade.
                USDC's stability makes it a safe haven compared to volatile cryptocurrencies, allowing you to lock in
                gains or park funds without worrying about sudden price drops. It's a critical piece of your strategy's
                endgame.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Since USDC is the only option currently, you don't need to make a choice
                here yet. In the future, if more target coins are added, you'd select based on your goals—like choosing
                a growth coin (e.g., ETH) for reinvestment or a stablecoin like USDC for security. For now, it's set to
                USDC automatically.</p>

        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field sets an upper limit on how much of your source coin (e.g., BTC,
                ETH) can be traded in a single transaction. It's a cap on the size of each individual trade, measured in
                units of the source coin you selected above.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> By capping trade size, you control risk exposure. If a trade goes south,
                a smaller size limits your loss. It's a safeguard against putting too much of your portfolio into one
                move, especially in volatile markets where big trades can amplify gains—or losses.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Think about your total holdings and risk tolerance. If you have 1 BTC,
                setting this to 0.1 BTC means no trade will use more than 10% of your stash. For a conservative
                approach, keep it low (e.g., 0.05 BTC); for bolder moves, raise it (e.g., 0.2 BTC). Check your wallet
                balance to ensure this value is realistic.</p>

        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field establishes the smallest amount of your source coin (e.g., BTC)
                that must be traded in any single transaction. It ensures trades aren't so tiny that they're
                insignificant or cost-inefficient.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Tiny trades can rack up fees that outweigh profits, especially with
                transaction costs. This setting keeps your trades meaningful, ensuring each one aligns with your
                strategy rather than cluttering your activity with negligible moves.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Set a value that's small but practical. For BTC, 0.0001 BTC might be a
                good minimum—enough to matter but not so big it restricts flexibility. If you're trading a cheaper coin
                like XDG, you might go higher (e.g., 10 XDG). Balance this with your maximum to create a sensible
                trading range. Make this above {{getMinimumCryptoAmount(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value ?? "BTC", 5)}}.</p>

        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field caps the amount of USDC you can spend in a single buy
                transaction when purchasing your source coin. It's a limit on how much stablecoin you're willing to
                deploy per trade.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This protects your USDC balance from being drained too quickly. By
                setting a ceiling, you avoid overcommitting to a single buy, which is crucial during price dips or when
                managing a limited budget.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Base this on your USDC holdings and risk appetite. With $10,000 in USDC,
                setting this to $1,000 keeps each buy at 10% of your stash. For smaller budgets (e.g., $500 total), try
                $50 to stay cautious. Adjust as your balance or strategy evolves.</p>

            title="Specify the minimum percentage spread required to trigger a trade." />
        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field sets the minimum percentage difference (or "spread") between
                the current market price and a reference price (e.g., last trade price or daily open) needed to trigger
                a trade. It's a filter to ensure trades only happen when there's enough potential profit.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Trading costs money—fees, slippage, etc. A higher threshold ensures the
                price movement justifies those costs, avoiding trades that barely break even. It's your profitability
                gatekeeper, especially for frequent traders.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> A value of 0.5% to 1% is common—e.g., if BTC is $50,000, a 1% threshold
                means a $500 move triggers the trade. Set it higher (e.g., 2%) for bigger, less frequent wins, or lower
                (e.g., 0.3%) for more action. Test it against past market data if possible. The default threshold for
                triggering a trade is set at {{tradeTradeThreshold.value | number:'1.4-4'}}, which translates to {{
                multiplyBy100(tradeTradeThreshold.value) | number:'1.2-2'}}%.</p>

            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field limits the percentage of your total account balance (across all
                coins) that can be used in any single trade. It's a portfolio-level risk control, not just tied to one
                coin.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Overcommitting to one trade can wipe out your account if it fails. This
                setting diversifies your risk, ensuring no single move bets the farm. It's a big-picture safety net for
                your trading capital.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> A safe range is 10% to 20%—e.g., with a $10,000 balance, 10% caps trades
                at $1,000. Conservative traders might use 5%, while aggressive ones might push to 25%. Align this with
                your overall financial goals and comfort with loss. The default ratio is set at
                {{tradeMaximumTradeBalanceRatio.value | number:'1.2-2'}}, which translates to {{

                unreserved USDC or source coin) is used for each trade. It's a dynamic allocation tool based on what's
                free to trade at the moment.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It controls trade size relative to your liquid funds, balancing
                aggression and caution. A higher percentage means bigger trades but less buffer; a lower one keeps more
                funds on the sidelines for flexibility.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Enter a decimal—e.g., 0.15 means 15% of available funds per trade. With
                $1,000 free, that's $150 per trade. Use 0.05 (5%) for slow and steady, or 0.3 (30%) for bolder plays.
                Adjust based on market conditions and your cash flow. The default percentage is set at
                {{tradeValueTradePercentage.value | number:'1.2-2'}}, which translates to {{

                sell in each sell transaction. It's about how much you offload at a time when taking profits or cutting
                losses.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Selling too much at once can leave you with no position to benefit from
                future gains; selling too little might not lock in enough profit. This setting fine-tunes your exit
                strategy, balancing exposure and cash flow.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Use a decimal—e.g., 0.04 means selling 4% of your {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} per trade. With 1
                {{tradeFromCoinSelect?.value?.replace('XBT', 'BTC')}, that's 0.04 {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} sold. Set 0.02 (2%) for gradual exits, or 0.1 (10%) for quicker liquidation. Pair
                this with market trends to time your sales effectively. The default percentage is set at

                trades.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without enough starting capital, trades might be too small to matter or
                might not even execute due to minimum order sizes on exchanges. This ensures your bot has enough fuel to
                operate meaningfully from the get-go.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> For BTC, 0.001 BTC might work—small but enough for a trade. For cheaper
                coins like XDG, try 50 XDG. Check exchange minimums (e.g., 0.0005 BTC on some platforms) and set this

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Trading with too little USDC can lead to failed trades or insignificant

                or 50% of your balance.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Jumping in with too much cash can expose you to early losses, especially

                if you're confident and well-funded. It's your opening bet size.</p>

        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field ensures a set amount of your {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} coin stays
                untouched by trading—it's your reserve stash, never sold or traded unless manually overridden.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Reserves act as a safety net. If markets crash or you need quick funds,
                this untouchable amount keeps you in the game. It's also handy for unexpected fees or holding a core
                position long-term.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> For BTC, 0.01 BTC might be a smart reserve—small but significant. With 1
                BTC total, that's 1% held back. Set higher (e.g., 0.05 BTC) if you're risk-averse or lower (e.g., 0.005
                BTC) if you want more to trade with. Match it to your comfort level.</p>

        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field locks away a minimum amount of USDC that your bot won't touch
                for trading. It's your stablecoin emergency fund, always available in your wallet.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Having USDC on hand gives you flexibility—think sudden buying
                opportunities, covering fees, or weathering a downturn without selling assets. It's your cash buffer in
                a volatile crypto world.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Set to $50 for a basic cushion with a $1,000 balance (5%). If you've got
                $10,000, try $200 for more wiggle room. Keep it low if you're aggressive, or higher if you like a safety
                net. It's your "don't touch" cash pile.</p>

            title="Set the maximum number of times a trade type (buy or sell) can occur." />
        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field limits how many buy or sell trades your bot can execute
                consecutively, depending on your bot's rules. For the Indicator strategy, its per 2 hours. For the DCA
                strategy, it applies separately to buys and sells—e.g., Max {{tradeTradeMaximumTypeOccurances.value}}
                consecutive buys or {{tradeTradeMaximumTypeOccurances.value}} consecutive sells.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Overtrading can lead to losses from fees or bad timing, especially in
                choppy markets. This cap keeps your bot disciplined, preventing it from going wild during volatility and
                burning through your funds.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Set to 5 for a balanced approach—5 buys and 5 sells daily or in a row.
                Drop to 2 or 3 for caution, or raise to 10 if you're chasing frequent action. Check your strategy's pace
                and market conditions to find the sweet spot.</p>

        <input type="number" #tradeVolumeSpikeMaxTradeOccurance
            title="Set a lower maximum for trade occurrences during volume spikes." />
        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field lowers the trade limit during high-volume market periods (e.g.,
                sudden price jumps). It overrides the regular Max Buy/Sell Trades when the bot detects a volume spike.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> High volume often means high volatility—great for gains, but risky for
                losses. Cutting trades here protects you from erratic moves, letting the market settle before jumping
                back in fully.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Set lower than your regular limit—e.g., 2 or 3 if your normal is 5. If
                you're at 10 normally, try 4 here. It's your "calm down" switch for crazy market days. Tweak based on
                how much chaos you can handle.</p>

    <!-- Stop-Loss Price (DCA only) -->

        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Exclusive to DCA, this field sets a specific USDC price for {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} 
                at which your bot sells everything if the price drops to or below this level. It's your
                hard stop to exit the position entirely.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> DCA builds positions over time, but a big crash can erase gains. This
                stop-loss caps your downside, protecting your capital from a prolonged bear market or sudden
                collapse—it's your panic button with a price tag.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> If your average {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} buy price is $50,000, set this 10% lower at $45,000
                to limit losses. If {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} hits $45,000, it's all sold to USDC. Set tighter (e.g., $48,000) for caution, or
                looser (e.g., $40,000) for more risk tolerance. Set it to 0 to have no stop-loss. Track your average
                cost to set this smartly.</p>

        <input type="number" #tradeStopLossPercentage
            title="For IND, set a percentage drop from the purchase price to liquidate your {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} position." />
        <div class="config-explanation">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> For the indicator strategy only, this field triggers a full sell-off of
                your {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} if its price drops by this percentage from your purchase price. It's a dynamic stop-loss tied
                to your entry point, not a fixed price.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The indicator strategy relies on indicators for timing, but markets can
                defy signals. This protects you from holding a losing position too long, automatically cutting losses
                when the trade sours beyond your set limit.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Enter a number like 5 (no % sign)—if you bought {{normalizeCoinName(tradeFromCoinSelect?.value)}} at $50,000, a 5% drop
                to $47,500 triggers a sell. Use 3 for tight control, or 10 if you're okay riding bigger dips. It's your
                "get out" rule based on your entry, so know your average buy price.</p>
