            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This dropdown menu allows you to choose between two distinct trading
                strategies: Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) or Indicator-based (IND) trading. DCA involves making regular
                investments at set intervals, regardless of market conditions, while IND uses technical market
                indicators to decide when to buy or sell.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Your choice here fundamentally shapes how your trading bot behaves. DCA
                is ideal for long-term investors who want to mitigate the effects of market volatility by spreading out
                their purchases over time. IND, on the other hand, is suited for traders who prefer to react to market
                signals, potentially capitalizing on short-term price movements.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Select "DCA" if you’re aiming for a steady, disciplined investment
                approach—think of it like setting up a recurring buy order to build your position gradually. Choose
                "IND" if you’re comfortable with a more dynamic strategy that relies on market indicators (like moving
                averages or RSI) to trigger trades. Your selection will determine which additional settings are
                displayed below.</p>

                (e.g., BTC, ETH, XRP), while IND restricts you to BTC only due to its strategy-specific requirements.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The coin you choose here defines one half of your trading pair and
                influences how your funds are allocated. For example, selecting BTC means you’re trading BTC to USDC.
                This choice also affects liquidity and volatility considerations, as different coins have different
                market behaviors.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Pick the cryptocurrency you currently hold and want to trade. If you’re
                using DCA, you might select ETH if that’s your primary holding, allowing you to diversify your trades.
                For IND, you’re locked into BTC, so ensure you have sufficient BTC in your wallet. The options adjust

            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This dropdown specifies the cryptocurrency you’ll receive after a
                trade—known as the "target" coin. Right now, it’s fixed to USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar,
                meaning all trades will convert your source coin into USDC.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The target coin is where your investment ends up after each trade.
                USDC’s stability makes it a safe haven compared to volatile cryptocurrencies, allowing you to lock in
                gains or park funds without worrying about sudden price drops. It’s a critical piece of your strategy’s
                endgame.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Since USDC is the only option currently, you don’t need to make a choice
                here yet. In the future, if more target coins are added, you’d select based on your goals—like choosing
                a growth coin (e.g., ETH) for reinvestment or a stablecoin like USDC for security. For now, it’s set to
                USDC automatically.</p>

        <div class="settingExplanation" (click)="toggleExplanation($event)">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field sets an upper limit on how much of your source coin (e.g., BTC,
                ETH) can be traded in a single transaction. It’s a cap on the size of each individual trade, measured in
                units of the source coin you selected above.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> By capping trade size, you control risk exposure. If a trade goes south,
                a smaller size limits your loss. It’s a safeguard against putting too much of your portfolio into one
                move, especially in volatile markets where big trades can amplify gains—or losses.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Think about your total holdings and risk tolerance. If you have 1 BTC,
                setting this to 0.1 BTC means no trade will use more than 10% of your stash. For a conservative
                approach, keep it low (e.g., 0.05 BTC); for bolder moves, raise it (e.g., 0.2 BTC). Check your wallet
                balance to ensure this value is realistic.</p>

            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field establishes the smallest amount of your source coin (e.g., BTC)
                that must be traded in any single transaction. It ensures trades aren’t so tiny that they’re
                insignificant or cost-inefficient.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Tiny trades can rack up fees that outweigh profits, especially with
                transaction costs. This setting keeps your trades meaningful, ensuring each one aligns with your
                strategy rather than cluttering your activity with negligible moves.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Set a value that’s small but practical. For BTC, 0.0001 BTC might be a
                good minimum—enough to matter but not so big it restricts flexibility. If you’re trading a cheaper coin
                like XDG, you might go higher (e.g., 10 XDG). Balance this with your maximum to create a sensible
                trading range.</p>

        <div class="settingExplanation" (click)="toggleExplanation($event)">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field caps the amount of USDC you can spend in a single buy
                transaction when purchasing your source coin. It’s a limit on how much stablecoin you’re willing to
                deploy per trade.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This protects your USDC balance from being drained too quickly. By
                setting a ceiling, you avoid overcommitting to a single buy, which is crucial during price dips or when
                managing a limited budget.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Base this on your USDC holdings and risk appetite. With $10,000 in USDC,
                setting this to $1,000 keeps each buy at 10% of your stash. For smaller budgets (e.g., $500 total), try

        <div class="settingExplanation" (click)="toggleExplanation($event)">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field sets the minimum percentage difference (or "spread") between
                the current market price and a reference price (e.g., last trade price or daily open) needed to trigger
                a trade. It’s a filter to ensure trades only happen when there’s enough potential profit.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Trading costs money—fees, slippage, etc. A higher threshold
                ensures the price movement justifies those costs, avoiding trades that barely break even. It’s your
                profitability gatekeeper, especially for frequent traders.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> A value of 0.5% to 1% is common—e.g., if BTC is $50,000, a 1% threshold
                means a $500 move triggers the trade. Set it higher (e.g., 2%) for bigger, less frequent wins, or lower
                (e.g., 0.3%) for more action. Test it against past market data if possible. The default threshold for
                triggering a trade is set at {{tradeTradeThreshold.value | number:'1.4-4'}}, which translates to {{

            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field limits the percentage of your total account balance (across all
                coins) that can be used in any single trade. It’s a portfolio-level risk control, not just tied to one
                coin.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Overcommitting to one trade can wipe out your account if it fails. This
                setting diversifies your risk, ensuring no single move bets the farm. It’s a big-picture safety net for
                your trading capital.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> A safe range is 10% to 20%—e.g., with a $10,000 balance, 10% caps trades
                at $1,000. Conservative traders might use 5%, while aggressive ones might push to 25%. Align this with
                your overall financial goals and comfort with loss. The default ratio is set at
                {{tradeMaximumTradeBalanceRatio.value | number:'1.2-2'}},

                free to trade at the moment.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> It controls trade size relative to your liquid funds, balancing
                aggression and caution. A higher percentage means bigger trades but less buffer; a lower one keeps more
                funds on the sidelines for flexibility.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Enter a decimal—e.g., 0.15 means 15% of available funds per trade. With
                $1,000 free, that’s $150 per trade. Use 0.05 (5%) for slow and steady, or 0.3 (30%) for bolder plays.
                Adjust based on market conditions and your cash flow. The default percentage is set at
                {{tradeValueTradePercentage.value | number:'1.2-2'}},

                or cutting losses.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Selling too much at once can leave you with no position to benefit from

                trades.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without enough starting capital, trades might be too small to matter or

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Trading with too little USDC can lead to failed trades or insignificant

                or 50% of your balance.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Jumping in with too much cash can expose you to early losses, especially

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Reserves act as a safety net. If markets crash or you need quick funds,
                this untouchable amount keeps you in the game. It’s also handy for unexpected fees or holding a core
                position long-term.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> For BTC, 0.01 BTC might be a smart reserve—small but significant. With 1

                $10,000, try $200 for more wiggle room. Keep it low if you’re aggressive, or higher if you like a safety
                net. It’s your “don’t touch” cash pile.</p>

        <div class="settingExplanation" (click)="toggleExplanation($event)">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field limits how many buy or sell trades your bot can execute within
                a day or consecutively, depending on your bot’s rules. It applies separately to buys and sells—e.g., 5
                buys and 5 sells max.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Overtrading can lead to losses from fees or bad timing, especially in
                choppy markets. This cap keeps your bot disciplined, preventing it from going wild during volatility and
                burning through your funds.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Set to 5 for a balanced approach—5 buys and 5 sells daily or in a row.
                Drop to 2 or 3 for caution, or raise to 10 if you’re chasing frequent action. Check your strategy’s pace
                and market conditions to find the sweet spot.</p>

        <input type="number" #tradeVolumeSpikeMaxTradeOccurance
            title="Set a lower maximum for trade occurrences during volume spikes." />
        <div class="settingExplanation" (click)="toggleExplanation($event)">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field lowers the trade limit during high-volume market periods (e.g.,
                sudden price jumps). It overrides the regular Max Buy/Sell Trades when the bot detects a volume
                spike.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> High volume often means high volatility—great for gains, but risky for
                losses. Cutting trades here protects you from erratic moves, letting the market settle before jumping
                back in fully.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Set lower than your regular limit—e.g., 2 or 3 if your normal is 5. If
                you’re at 10 normally, try 4 here. It’s your “calm down” switch for crazy market days. Tweak based on
                how much chaos you can handle.</p>

    <div class="optionsStatsDescription">
        <input type="number" #tradeStopLoss
            title="For DCA, set a USDC price point to liquidate your entire BTC position." />
        <div class="settingExplanation" (click)="toggleExplanation($event)">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Exclusive to DCA, this field sets a specific USDC price for BTC (or your
                source coin) at which your bot sells everything if the price drops to or below this level. It’s your
                hard stop to exit the position entirely.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> DCA builds positions over time, but a big crash can erase gains. This
                stop-loss caps your downside, protecting your capital from a prolonged bear market or sudden
                collapse—it’s your panic button with a price tag.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> If your average BTC buy price is $50,000, set this 10% lower at $45,000
                to limit losses. If BTC hits $45,000, it’s all sold to USDC. Set tighter (e.g., $48,000) for caution, or
                looser (e.g., $40,000) for more risk tolerance. Track your average cost to set this smartly.</p>

            title="For IND, set a percentage drop from the purchase price to liquidate your BTC position." />
        <div class="settingExplanation" (click)="toggleExplanation($event)">
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> For IND only, this field triggers a full sell-off of your BTC if its price
                drops by this percentage from your purchase price. It’s a dynamic stop-loss tied to your entry point,
                not a fixed price.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> IND relies on indicators for timing, but markets can defy signals. This
                protects you from holding a losing position too long, automatically cutting losses when the trade sours
                beyond your set limit.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> Enter a number like 5 (no % sign)—if you bought BTC at $50,000, a 5% drop
                to $47,500 triggers a sell. Use 3 for tight control, or 10 if you’re okay riding bigger dips. It’s your
                “get out” rule based on your entry, so know your average buy price.</p>

            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This field shows the timestamp of when you last saved your trading
                settings. It’s a read-only indicator, updating automatically after each save, or displays “Never” if you
                haven’t saved yet.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Keeping track of updates ensures you’re running the bot with your latest
                intentions. If it’s been a while (or says “Never”), your settings might not match your current strategy,
                risking outdated trades.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> No input needed—it’s just info. Check it to confirm your changes are
                live. If it’s old (e.g., weeks ago) and markets have shifted, review and save again. It’s your settings’
                “last modified” label—use it to stay current.</p>

        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This button saves all your current settings to the server, locking in your
            trading configuration. It tells your bot exactly how to behave based on everything you’ve set
            above—strategy, amounts, thresholds, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without saving, your bot runs on old or default settings, which might not
            align with your goals. This ensures your tweaks take effect, keeping your trades intentional and up-to-date
            with your plan.</p>
        <p><strong>How to use it:</strong> After adjusting settings, click “Save” to apply them. It’s disabled while
            saving (to avoid double-clicks), so wait for it to reactivate. Save often—e.g., after major edits or market
            shifts—to keep your bot in sync with your strategy.</p>
