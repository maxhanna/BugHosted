# Copilot Instructions for Code Editing

## General Workflow
- Before making any code change, ensure the code compiles and is free of errors.
- Use the latest Angular standards and best practices for all frontend work.
- Avoid deprecated or discouraged patterns (e.g., do not use `ngModel`).
- Prefer `[value]` and `(input)` for input binding, and `[class]` for dynamic classes instead of `[ngClass]`.
- Always validate that your changes do not introduce new errors or warnings.
- If a change would break compilation, do not apply it and notify the user.
- Document any non-trivial changes or refactors in commit messages or comments as appropriate.

## Angular Specifics
 - Do NOT assign values or call multiple expressions directly in HTML event handlers (e.g., `(input)="fileSearchComponent.searchTerms = $event.target.value; fileSearchComponent.getDirectory();"`).
	 Instead, create a function in the TypeScript file and call it from the template (e.g., `(input)="onSearchInput($event)"`).
- Use standalone components and modules where possible.
- Prefer reactive forms over template-driven forms for complex input handling.
- Use `[value]` and `(input)` for input elements.
- Use `[class]` for dynamic class binding.
- Follow Angular style guide for file and folder structure.
- Use HttpClient for all HTTP requests.
- Avoid use of `any` type; prefer explicit interfaces and types.
- Use Observables and RxJS for asynchronous operations.

## Backend (C#) Specifics
- Ensure all controller actions validate input and return appropriate status codes.
- Use async/await for all database and IO operations.
- Validate all user input before processing.
- Document API endpoints with comments.
 - Place simple DTOs and helper classes used by controller endpoints under the controller's `DataContracts` folder as separate class files (e.g., `Controllers/DataContracts/YourDto.cs`). Do not declare endpoint helper classes inline inside controller files.

## Editing Style for Adding Methods
- When adding new methods to an existing class, append them at the end of the class body (just before the final closing brace) rather than inserting them at the top of the class. This preserves the original logical ordering and minimizes merge conflicts.
- If adding multiple related helper methods, group them together near other helpers (still placed at the end) and add a short comment header describing their purpose.
- For TypeScript/Angular components follow the same approach: append new component methods/properties to the end of the class in the TypeScript file.

## Error Handling
- After every edit, check for compile and lint errors.
- If errors are found, fix them before proceeding with further changes.
- If unable to fix, notify the user and halt further edits.

## Commit/Change Documentation
- Summarize the purpose of each change in a comment or commit message.
- For multi-file changes, list affected files and a brief description of the change.

## Project peculiarities & guidance for Copilot-style agents

- Backend is .NET (C#) + MySQL and many controllers use manual, parameterized SQL with explicit transactions; prefer `async/await` and keep the transaction in the same method when editing controller flows.
- Many database columns can be NULL. Avoid calling `reader.GetString(...)` or similar directly without checking `IsDBNull` (or use a small helper like `SafeGetString`). Prefer ordinals, `IsDBNull`, or Convert.ToString for nullable columns.
- Controllers use raw SQL in strings and helper methods under `Controllers/` and `Controllers/DataContracts/` for DTOs â€” add new DTOs under `DataContracts/` per the existing pattern.
- When replacing expensive in-memory loops that join DB-backed sets (e.g., hero vs wall collision), prefer moving the work into a single parameterized SQL query (CTE or grouped subquery) to let the DB optimize joins and use indexes.
- Client is Angular (TypeScript).  
- Avoid broad refactors in a single patch. Make small, focused edits (one logical change per patch) and run build/tests after each change.
- After server-side edits, run `dotnet build` in `maxhanna.Server` and fix compile errors before proceeding. After client-side edits, run the client build (or at least `tsc`) if possible to catch type errors.
- Style: preserve existing indentation, method ordering (append helper methods at the end of classes), and use the same exception logging pattern (`_log.Db(...)`) when adding new server-side error handling.
- Tests & verification: for non-trivial server changes, prefer a tiny integration smoke check (exercise endpoint) and collect error traces if the change hits production errors.

Keep this section minimal and update it when new repo conventions appear.
