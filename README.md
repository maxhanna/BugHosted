# BugHosted

A living sandbox platform that fuses: social networking, competitive mini‑games, retro console emulation, AI assistance, on‑site file hosting, realtime strategy (Bug‑Wars), creative tools, a crypto operations hub, a web crawler/search layer, and daily brain games—under one extensible UI shell.

### Core Pillars
* Create, share, chat, meme, post, rank, vote, notify.
* Play: Wordler, Mastermind, Bug‑Wars RTS, Array descent, Ender micro‑game, retro ROMs via the Emulator.
* Build & host: robust file system powering media everywhere (thumbnails cached on demand).
* Explore & index the web: integrated web crawler + searchable dataset.
* Automate & analyze: Crypto-Hub (prices, wallets, rigs, bots) + HostAi assistant.
* Customize: themes, favourites, playlists, profiles, art, user settings.

### Security & Encryption
BugHosted is designed for full end‑to‑end encryption (E2EE) of sensitive user data, an implementation for quantum‑resistant cryptography. This mitigates “harvest‑now, decrypt‑later” threats, as well as any type of man in the middle attack. 
* Zero server plaintext access for private user content where feasible.
